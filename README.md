 It is a program which takes an array of integers and allows the user to reverse a part of the array based on a user-defined index.

Information of how it works:
1) It implements dynamic memory allocation to store the reversed subarray.
2) Also here is included input validation to ensure the user input is within valid bounds.
3) Added functionality to print out in both cases the index and value during filling temp array with reversed data and output of reversed data.
4) In the end I used free() to prevent memory leaks.
